                Full Stack Europe is the international conference for developers who want to learn across the stack. Step out of your comfort zone and improve not only your existing skills, but learn new ones as well. Do you identify as full stack or are you interested in front end, back end, devops, design or anything in between? This is the conference for you!

                For the 2021 edition, we feel that an in-person conference is still a bit too early. That's why for 2021 we're going online! Instead of talks we'll present you a wide variety of workshops. These will be excellent for you to progress in that one specific skill you want to learn more about. <a href="{{ route('home', 2022) }}">In 2022, we'll be back with an in-person edition!</a>
