    <h1>Sustainability</h1>

    <p>As a conference, we are not climate neutral. However, we lower our impact on the environment as much as possible, Inspired by the 8 Râ€™s (Recycle - Refuse - Reduce - Reuse - Repair - Regift - Recover - Rethink). We welcome feedback on how to improve. Our current initiatives:</p>

    <h2>Travel</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>We're a remote-first company, and use public transport where possible.</li>
        <li>We book travel for our speakers so we can offer more sustainable alternatives (such as trains) instead of flights.</li>
        <li>We carbon offsett the flights we book.</li>
        <li>We encourage our participants to come by train if possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Venue</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>We look for venues that are easily reachable by public transport.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Catering</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>We offer a minimum of 50% vegetarian food (and vegan is available upon request). We try to provide a very balanced buffet, but we prefer chicken over meat and we refrain from food like tuna etc.</li>
        <li>We closely estimate our food amount through a careful headcount to minimise waste. We create awareness with our attendees to not throw away food. We are looking into the options of donating leftover food.</li>
        <li>Drinks are offered in porcelain and glassware. We provide water bottles with tap water.</li>
        <li>We provide bio straws (we can offer plastic straws for those who need it for accessibility reasons).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recycling</h2>

    <p>During the conference we optimize waste processing and recycling. We have separate trash cans with bio compostable garbage bags, for all compostables. We also have separate paper bins.</p>
