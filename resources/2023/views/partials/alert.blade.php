                <p class="mb-4">Last night, before the football match between Sweden and Belgium, a terrorist shot three Swedish fans, as a reaction to a Quran burning in Sweden. The suspect has been apprehended by the Belgian police.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Belgium has raised the security threat level from 2 to 3. Right now, air and train travel is not affected. The Belgian and the Swedish governments both recommend to be vigilant. They did not issue a warning against traveling, as they do not see a heightened risk.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Therefore, we are proceeding with the conference as planned, and hope that you will join as well.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Please be aware that a lot of misinformation regarding the incident is being spread on social media. We advise to only consult official sources.</p>
